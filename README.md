# Downloading and using easey-design-system

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Project running node
- A ```.yarnrc``` file existing in the root directory, with the contents of: ``` @us-epa-camd:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com ```
- [Authenticate to github package registry on local machine](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry)

### Installing
- Select desired version of package. The most up to date package version is [![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/US-EPA-CAMD%2Feasey-design-system.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/US-EPA-CAMD%2Feasey-design-system) . <br>
- In terminal execute ```yarn add @us-epa-camd/easey-design-system``` for latest current version or ```yarn add @us-epa-camd/easey-design-system@VERSION``` to install a specific version

### Using
- Import desired files from folder within package.
- For example, to insert the Header: ``` import { Header } from '@us-epa-camd/easey-design-system/Header'; ```

# Adding and publishing to easey-design-system

## Getting Started 
These instructions will show you how to edit the existing package, and publish a new version.

### Prerequisites
- Clone easey-design-system github master branch on your local machine

### Viewing the storybook locally
- After invoking the ```yarn``` command to download the projects packages, invoke ```yarn storybook```

### Adding Components
- Add a new directory to the Components folder within the src of the easey-design-system
- Populate directory with the .scss styling file for your component, the base .tsx React component, and a .stories.tsx file for the [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-stories)
- Finally, export * from the component within the src/index.ts

## Publishing new package version
- On the current branch in terminal, add all file changes with ```git add .```
- Commit files using ``` yarn commit ``` which executes the [commitizen](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) plugin, a commit formatter that is digestible by [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/)
- Follow the prompts and create your commit
- Push the commit to your current branch
``` git push origin CURRENT_BRANCH```
- Github workflows for this package are set up to create new package versions whenever a push or merge to the ```N.B.x, N.x (N is a number), master, next, next-major, beta, or alpha``` branches is executed
- Semantic-Release will version all code automatically, based on the input received from the commitizen commit

## Maintenance Releases
[semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) supports releasing patches for previously released versions where it is not possible to fully upgrade to the more recent versions. This is accomplished using the `N.N.x and N.x` branch names where N is the version you want to release a patch. If it is required to release a patch to a previously released version then the following steps must be followed to properly release a new patch version.

1. Determine the version to be patched
2. Clone or pull latest from easey-common
3. Create `N.N.x` or `N.x` branch
   - If the version has subsequent versions after it
     - Create `N.N.x` branch with N being the major and minor version of the version being patched
     - Example using v1.0.0 to be patched and the v1.0.0 release tag
       - `git checkout -b 1.0.x v1.0.0`
   - If the version does NOT have subsequent versions after it
     - Create `N.x` branch with N being the major version of the version being patched
     - Example using v1.1.0 to be patched and the v1.1.0 release tag
       - `git checkout -b 1.x v1.1.0`
4. Implement changes in `N.N.x` or `N.x` branch and then follow the same steps above to commit changes using `yarn commit`
5. Release workflow will release a new patch version for the version you choose to be patched
